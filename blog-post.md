# About me

My name is Steven Miller. Today I'm learning about Markdown and HTML. I'm attending a one-month trial of Fidgetech, albeit virtually due to Covid-19.

## Favorite food
Chips, _especially_ those with a spicy kick. My favorite flavor is that of the Tapatio Hot Sauce flavored Doritos.

## Favorite vacation destination
California. So much to do, so much to see, plus I've got relatives down there.

-----------
By the way, happy Inauguration Day, everyone!
